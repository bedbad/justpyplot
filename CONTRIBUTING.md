# Contributing to JustPyPlot

Justpyplot is still in seed stage and is rapidly inflecting
We welcome contributions from all, the code of justpyplot itself is perfect exercise to 
learn vectorized tensor operations. Competent contributors should focus on the codebase while for
beginner contributors we reserve documentation, formating and presentation issues under regular feedback

## How to contribute

- Read the post from this list with suggestions of community, these posts are updating:
 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1f7jfgd/why_not_just_get_your_plots_in_numpy/

- Create an issue that is raised in the posts or you noticed in documentation or README.md if not exists already
    - Choose correct issue tag (feature request, documentation, bug, package)
    - Proof read your text with tools like grammarly
    - If it's a bug be clear about what the actual and expected behaviors are
    - If it's a feature be clear about proposed steps to implement it
    - If it's a usecase - feature request please specify in detail your *real* need and how you work it currently
        -  add a PR for README.md with your usecase using justpyplot
- **Fork the repository**
    - Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy of the repository.
    - If you are adding a usecase modify your version of README.md right there and then press the Pull Request button
        - *Your contribution will be reviewed very quickly(within day or even hours)! Thank you for contributing!*
    - If it's documentation or other readme documents it is not necessary to clone the repository
- **Clone the repository**
    - Create new branch with github handle/name ( `git branch -c`)
    - Commit your work in that branch **as frequently as you can** `git commit -m` with descriptive messages
        - it's best to use auto generated commit messages, there is vscode plugin for that as well as tools for other editors

- **Repeat**
    - Any contribution is welcome however at this stage we are looking for contributors who will stick to it
    - Amass 10 documentation or 5 code contributions successfully and you will automatically be added to maintainer with write rights to the repo

    - We want to make it clear that a single maintainer who contributed the bulk of the project, by clear margin more then any other maintainer will get the ownership of the project. We state that this rule will not change.
